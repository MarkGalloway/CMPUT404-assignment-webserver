_ - require the Host: header from HTTP 1.1 clients  
_ - accept absolute URL's in a request  
_ - accept requests with chunked data  
_ - either support persistent connections, or include the "Connection: close" header with each response  
_ - use the "100 Continue" response appropriately  
X - include the Date: header in each response  
_ - handle requests with If-Modified-Since: or If-Unmodified-Since: headers
